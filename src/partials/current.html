        As an undergraduate, I studied design where I developed my skills in creativity and attention to detail.
        However, technology was, and still is, my biggest passion. The role of a software enginner with focus on front-end allows me to be a part of both worlds.
        I enjoy creating an effortless user experience and am always striving to find the best solution for user-facing problems.

        My journey starts in San Francisco Bay Area at Cost Plus World Market back in 2011.
        I joined the marketing team as a UI/UX enginner to work on a website visited by millions of users on a daily basis.
        It was my first experience as an engineer with a huge set of responsibilities.
        Iâ€™ve learned a lot since then, grew as an engineer, and have become an active team member with enthusiasm for solving technical problems.
