          I'm a creative person, I studied design in university and spent most of my time freelancing as a web-designer building clean and elegant user interfaces. I'm also an engineer, and in a short period of time I learned the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript and got involved into the world where I could bring my designs to life. I enjoy creating effortless user experience, designing delightful digital products and I'm always hungry to create new things.

        <p class="c-paragraph">
          In September 2011, I moved to San Francisco Bay Area and joined the marketing team at World Market. That was the first time in my career that I had work for the company with 1 billion in revenue and the website with audience of millions. I became an engineer who is taking pride in writing elegant, reliable, testable, and maintainable code. I love setting up goals and delivering on them and feel happy when I help and mentor those around me.

              School and University years were full of sport and creative activities. I was a member of soccer and track and field teams, studied music and design. Participated and was a multiple times winner in National and European competitions. But my biggest and only competition is myself.

              I believe that my job is more than just writing a clean code, my job is to build bridges between the people who has the idea and people who wants to see this idea live. One of my recent ideas is automatic screenshoting tool for product and marketing teams, I’m designing and building on my free time with awsome people.
