          I'm a creative person, I studied design in university and spent most of my time freelancing as a web-designer building clean and elegant user interfaces. I'm also an engineer, and in a short period of time I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and got involved into the margic world where I could bring my designs to life. I enjoy creating effortless user experience and designing delightful digital products. I'm always hungry to create new things.

        <p class="c-paragraph">
          In September 2011, I moved to San Francisco Bay Area and joined the marketing team at World Market. That was the first time in my career that I had work for the company with 1 billion in revenue and the website with audience of millions. I became an engineer who is taking pride in writing elegant, reliable, testable, and maintainable code. I love setting up goals and delivering on them and feel happy when I help and mentor those around me.
