## Description
---
Personal website for Mihail Gumennii - Senior Front-End Engineer.
It is built with following old traditions of semantic HTML, clean CSS and Pure JavaScript.
But, CSS is written with PostCSS plugins and JavaScript is using ES6 features.

## Development
---
I assume Node.js is installed on comupter.

* `yarn install` - install all dependencies
* `yarn styles` - watch for css files and run them through PostCSS plugins
